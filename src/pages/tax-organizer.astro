                        <strong>Download and Install Adobe Acrobat Reader</strong><br>

                        Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install Adobe Acrobat Reader on your computer.<br>
                        If you already have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed, please ensure it is up-to-date.

                        Click "Allow". This is necessary for the form to submit your data to our secure server.<br>
                        <em>Error Dialogue (Expected):</em> After clicking allow, an error dialogue box may appear. This is a normal part of the submission process and can be disregarded.<br>
                        <em>Success Page Redirection:</em> After the form is successfully submitted, you will be automatically redirected to a success page.<br>
                        <em>Confirmation Message:</em> The success page will display the message: "Your form has been submitted successfully."<br>
                        <em>Verification:</em> If you see the success message, it confirms that your filled form has been sent to us for processing.
